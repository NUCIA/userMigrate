# UserMigrate.ps1

## Introduction

This is a simple Powershell script for transferring user directories between
differnet Windows shares. It is built to preserve specific permissions that
were needed when the script was run. This is provided here as an example.

## Pull Requests

I welcome pull requests if you see any way to improve the script. For
starters, it could be made more flexible for different permission sets.
